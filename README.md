# Face-Recognition
This is keras implementetion of the face recognizer described in the paper ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832). The project also uses ideas from [Andrew Ng](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjD_p_d6NnqAhVF6nMBHYyKCPUQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAndrew_Ng&usg=AOvVaw2LbWH5rpY5AMpcPkIpID2t)'s last weak assignment Deep Learning course Convolutional Neural Network on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).
